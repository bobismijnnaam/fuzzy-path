I made this for the #1GAM GameDev challenge: http://www.onegameamonth.com
This is my december game: I MADE IT!

===========
HOW TO PLAY
===========
1) Start fuzzy-path.exe
2) Click PLAY
3) Draw paths along the squares. Make sure the colors of the squares alternate as much as possible. For each switch you get points. The longer the path, the more points you get! But watch out: if two subsequent squares have the same color, points will be subtracted from your score. Good luck!

To make this I used SFML, the MinGW C++ compiler, GIMP (can't do without a solid RGB color picker y'know) and SublimeText.
